By leveraging advanced data analytics techniques, the study aimed to understand user behaviors, identify trends, and recommend strategies for improving the user experience with Bellabeat products.

## Methodology
The methodology for this project followed a structured data analysis process, comprising six key phases:

### Phase 1: Ask
- **Business Task**: Analyze smart device usage data to gain insights into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. The goal was to apply these insights to Bellabeat's marketing strategy.
- **Questions for Analysis**:
  - What are some trends in smart device usage?
  - How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
  - How could these trends help influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy?

### Phase 2: Prepare
- **Dataset Used**: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, available through Kaggle and collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016 and 05.12.2016.
- **Data Description**: The dataset included information on user activity levels, steps taken, calories burned, and sleep patterns.

### Phase 3: Process
- **Data Cleaning**: Data was cleaned to remove inconsistencies and inaccuracies. This involved handling missing values, correcting data types, and filtering out irrelevant records.
- **Data Manipulation**: Prepared the dataset for analysis by creating new variables and aggregating data as needed.

### Phase 4: Analyze
- **Data Exploration**: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of user activity levels, usage patterns, and correlations between different metrics.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performed statistical tests and calculated correlation coefficients to identify significant relationships between variables.

### Phase 5: Share
